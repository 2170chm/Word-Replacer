# Contributing

This project is open-source, which means that it accepts contributions of value
from anyone who decides to contribute to it. Some ways to contribute can be
found below. If you are unsure how to use git or other tools relevant to
contribuing, we advise that you consult an online tutorial before contributing,
but mastery of said tools is certainly not a requirement.

## Reporting Issues

If you find a bug, typo, or other unintended behavior, we would ask that you
create a Github issue with a description of the environment the behavior
occurred in, steps to replicate it, and expected behavior, in addition to
describing the unintended behavior in detail. Expect a response time of a few
days for a contributor to evaluate the issue.

## Contributing

We welcome any contributors who would like to add to the project in any way,
including implementing features, adding or expanding documentation/translations,
etc. 

In order to contribute to the repository, we ask that you create an issue
explaining the content of your contribution, and then create a pull request that
links to your issue from a fork of this repository. This will ensure that
tracking new features and contributions is as easy as possible. Contributors who
do not have write access to the repository can expect their contributions to be
reviewed and approved by a repository maintainer within a few days of
submission.
